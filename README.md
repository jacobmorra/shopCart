# shopCart
A shopping cart which allows users to add items, remove items, and check items out.

#1. Introduction
##1.1 Purpose of this software

The overall purpose of “shopCart” is a to allow user selection (including addition and removal) of shopping cart items given a specified list of items (with photos, quantities, and prices for each) in addition to a checkout feature, whereby the user is able to pay for said items via PayPal.

Secondary features of the “shopCart” software include user login and logout, forgotten password recovery, password change, session and cookie-based user information and web pages, and user validation via Captcha implementation.

##1.2 Benefits of the Software:

The shopCart page allows users to add, remove, and checkout items for purchase. The overall benefit of the software is that it allows users to shop from the comfort of their homes online; it serves as a quicker and more efficient alternative to a physical store.

##1.3 Objectives of the Software:

The overall objective for this software is to allow users to register, login to the site, and add and remove cart items; secondary objectives include additional user functionality (logout, password change, retrieving forgotten password, clearing the shopping cart, receiving a total cost, etc.)

##1.4 Goals for this Software:

One of the major goals for this software is a user-friendly interface. Page-width divs, tables with alternating row-background-colors, and buttons are used so that users can easily see page contents and are aware of what clicking each link does. For example, the implementation of “+” and “-“ buttons for each item allows the user to quickly observe how to add and remove items.

Another major goal for this software is effective page-redirect functionality. For example, in the registration page (register.php), the file regscript.php (which processes the registration form) redirects the user to register.php (although in the code it actually appends the page) to display an error messages instead instead of removing the user from the form they just filled out. Simple page-redirect utilizations such as this can ultimately improve the user experience when using this software.

#2. Overall Description

##2.3	Operating Environment

####Testing Environment:

All files were stored within the Apache server (C:\xampp\htdocs\mywork\shopCart) on a local machine.

The operating system used to build and test shopCart was Windows 8 (64-bit). 

The browser used to build and test shopCart was Google Chrome v.46.0.2490.86.


#3.	External Interface Requirements

##3.1	User Interfaces

The user interface for shopCart takes advantage of css styling and bootstrap implementation (v 3.2.0) to create full-width divs and simple buttons. 

The primary user interface goals include simplicity and usability. Sample pages taken from shopCart will be evaluated based on these goals. 

First, consider the site homepage (frontpage.php):

#####Simplicity: The site title is centered at the top of the page; a return-home button on the top left (shopping cart icon) returns the user home at any time; the login form is focused in the middle of the page and alternative options (forgotten password, register) are vertically offset from the login form.

#####Usability: Cart items are shown at the bottom of the page but are faded out and not clickable (users cannot accidentally add items without registering); all links go directly to pages intuitively. 

Next, consider the registration page (register.php):

#####Simplicity: The page title is centered at the top of the page; a return-home button on the top left (shopping cart icon) returns the user home at any time; the registration instructions are short and clearly stated; the Captcha image is simple and easily viewable.
 
#####Usability: In the screen capture above, the user has failed to enter the correct Captcha information. Instead of the user having to load to another page, the same page appears except with a notification box below the registration form. The user immediately knows the issue.

Next, consider the user homepage (frontuser.php) – user is logged in:

#####Simplicity: The page title is centered at the top of the page; a return-home button on the top left (shopping cart icon) returns the user home at any time; all buttons do as indicated (i.e. the change password button takes the user to the change password page).
 
#####Usability: A welcome message tells the user that they have logged in implicitly; buttons for logout, change password, and checkout are clearly viewable above the items; items all have pictures, prices, and add/remove buttons.

Finally, consider the shopCart checkout page (checkout.php):


#####Simplicity: The page title is centered at the top of the page; a return-home button on the top left (shopping cart icon) returns the user home at any time; a clear cart button allows the user to clear all items with a single click, the item names, prices, and quantity is viewable in table format.
 
#####Usability: All buttons (i.e. clear cart) correspond to button actions. One issue with usability here is the failure of the “Buy Now” button to actually activate a payment method; in a real-life implementation this feature would be implemented fully.

##3.2 Software Interfaces

* XAMPP Control Panel v3.2.1 (with Apache version 2.4.16 and mysql 5.0.11)
  * Constraint: Apache and MySQL must both be operational for full site functionality

* shopCart selects, fetches, updates, inserts data with the shopcartusers database
  *tables within the shopcartusers database include userinfo and usercart

* Bootstrap (v.3.2.0) to enhance div dimensions and appearance/ button creation
